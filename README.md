# üéì Student Management System (with Custom Exceptions)

A Java-based Student Management System that enables users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records through a menu-driven interface. This system uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and features comprehensive exception handling using custom exceptions.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Files and Classes

1. **`Student.java`**  
   Represents the `Student` class, encapsulating student data and access methods.

2. **`StudentOperations.java`**  
   Contains logic for managing student records such as adding, searching, editing, deleting, and displaying.

3. **`Main.java`**  
   The entry point of the program. Implements a console-based menu for interacting with the student system.
